After creating our profile on GitHub, we'd add a new repo(repositary) to make our future tasts and homework visible to our teacher. Off course, we may create private repo-s also to save whatever we want. 
F1 opens command palette. Here is where we can create, rename, delete or duplicate files using File.utils' tools.
The <>code window allows us to share our repo.
We can change theme colors using for example Andromeda or GitHub Theme extentions.
For creating new GitHub repo from local terminal git init
In order to add our local files to a new GitHub repositary we need to do following steps:
git config --global user.name "shushmanuk"      to be recognized by GitHub
git config --global user.email "shushanik.manukian@gmail.com"   to let GitHub to identify our email address
