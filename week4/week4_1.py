# "13 > 44 > 33 > 1" ➞ False

# "1 < 2 < 6 < 9 > 3" ➞ True

# "minnie mouse", "?" ➞ "m?nn?? m??s?"

# "shakespeare", "*" ➞ "sh*k*sp**r*"

# 8. Write a function that takes a credit card number and only displays
# the last four characters. The rest of the card number must be replaced by ************.

# Examples
# "1234123456785678" ➞ "************5678"

# "8754456321113213" ➞ "************3213"

# "35123413355523" ➞ "**********5523"
