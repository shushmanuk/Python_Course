"""1. Write a function that takes a string name and a number num (either 0 or 1)

Examples
say_hello_bye("alon", 1) ➞ "Hello Alon"

say_hello_bye("Tomi", 0) ➞ "Bye Tomi"

say_hello_bye("jose", 0) ➞ "Bye Jose" """

"""2. Create a function that takes a list (slot machine outcome) and returns 
True if all elements in the list are identical, and False otherwise. 
The list will contain 4 elements.

Examples
test_jackpot(["@", "@", "@", "@"]) ➞ True

"""3. Create a function that takes an array of hurdle heights and a jumper's 
jump height, and determine whether or not the hurdler can clear all the hurdles.

A hurdler can clear a hurdle if their jump height is greater than or equal to
the hurdle height.

Examples
hurdle_jump([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) ➞ True

hurdle_jump([5, 5, 3, 4, 5], 3) ➞ False

hurdle_jump([5, 4, 5, 6], 10) ➞ True

hurdle_jump([1, 2, 1], 1) ➞ False
Notes
Return True for the edge case of an empty array of hurdles. 
(Zero hurdles means that any jump height can clear them)."""
 
"""4. Create a function that takes a number as its argument and returns a list
of all its factors.

Examples
factorize(12) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]

factorize(4) ➞ [1, 2, 4]

factorize(17) ➞ [1, 17]
Notes
The input integer will be positive.
A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number without leaving 
a remainder. The second example is a factor of 12, because 12 / 2 = 6, with 
remainder 0. """

"""5. Create a function that returns the number of palindrome numbers in a 
specified range (inclusive).

For example, between 8 and 34, there are 5 palindromes: 8, 9, 11, 22 and 33. 
Between 1550 and 1552 there is exactly one palindrome: 1551.

Examples
count_palindromes(1, 10) ➞ 9

count_palindromes(555, 556) ➞ 1

count_palindromes(878, 898) ➞ 3
Notes
A palindrome number is a number which remains the same when its digits are 
reversed. For example, 2552 reversed is still 2552. The reflectional symmetry 
of this number makes it a palindromic number.
Single-digit numbers are trivially palindrome numbers."""

"""6. Write a function that takes a string, breaks it up and returns it 
with vowels first, consonants second. For any character that's not a vowel 
(like special characters or spaces), treat them like consonants.

Examples
split("abcde") ➞ "aebcd"

split("Hello!") ➞ "eoHll!"

split("What's the time?") ➞ "aeieWht's th tm?"
Notes
Vowels are a, e, i, o, u.
Define a separate is_vowel() function for easier to read code (recommendation)."""

"""7. Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a coded 
(h4ck3r 5p34k) version of the string.

Examples
hacker_speak("javascript is cool") ➞ "j4v45cr1pt 15 c00l"

hacker_speak("programming is fun") ➞ "pr0gr4mm1ng 15 fun"

hacker_speak("become a coder") ➞ "b3c0m3 4 c0d3r"
Notes
In order to work properly, the function should replace all "a"s with 4, 
"e"s with 3, "i"s with 1, "o"s with 0, and "s"s with 5."""

"""8. Create a function that takes an integer and returns it as an ordinal 
number. An Ordinal Number is a number that tells the position of something 
in a list, such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.

Examples
return_end_of_number(553) ➞ "553-RD"

return_end_of_number(34) ➞ "34-TH"

return_end_of_number(1231) ➞ "1231-ST"

return_end_of_number(412) ➞ "412-TH" """

"""9. Create a function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

Examples
convert("35*C") ➞ "95*F"

convert("19*F") ➞ "-7*C"

convert("33") ➞ "Error"
Notes
Round to the nearest integer.
If the input is incorrect, return "Error".
For the formulae to convert back and forth, check the Resources tab."""

"""10. Create a function that finds the reverse complement of a ribonucleic
acid (RNA) strand. The RNA will be represented as a string containing only 
the characters "A", "C", "G" and "U". Since RNA can only (canonically) allow 
pairings of A/U and G/C, the complement of an RNA would be as follows:

Original	Complement
"AAA"	"UUU"
"UUU"	"AAA"
"GGG"	"CCC"
"CCC"	"GGG"
Your function should find the complement on the right AND also reverse the 
resulting string.

Examples
reverse_complement("GUGU") ➞ "ACAC"

reverse_complement("UCUCG") ➞ "CGAGA"

reverse_complement("CAGGU") ➞ "ACCUG"
Notes
You can assume all input seqeuences will be valid."""

"""11. Create a function to perform basic arithmetic operations that includes
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on a string number 
(e.g. "12 + 24" or "23 - 21" or "12 // 12" or "12 * 21").

Here, we have 1 followed by a space, operator followed by another space and 2. 
For the challenge, we are going to have only two numbers between 1 valid 
operator. The return value should be a number.

eval() is not allowed. In case of division, whenever the second number equals
"0" return -1.

For example:

"15 // 0"  ➞ -1
Examples
arithmetic_operation("12 + 12") ➞ 24 // 12 + 12 = 24

arithmetic_operation("12 - 12") ➞ 24 // 12 - 12 = 0

arithmetic_operation("12 * 12") ➞ 144 // 12 * 12 = 144

arithmetic_operation("12 // 0") ➞ -1 // 12 / 0 = -1
Notes
All the inputs are only integers.
The operators are * - + and //.
Hint: Think about the single space that appears before and after 
the arithmetic operator."""
